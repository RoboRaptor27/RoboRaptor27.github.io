RoboRaptor27 was created for college class assignments and will be used as such.
This repository is the first assignment for the class in question.
When I had downloaded github onto my desktop it automatically created a destination for future repositories in my documents. From here it had not asked for confirmation for cloning. When told to clone it went ahead and downloaded the repository and filed it in my documents. After which it had opened the clone in the application.
